Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue. Overweight/obese children have a
high risk of being obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. It has been proposed that
epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in mediating long-term metabolic
dysfunction.  

Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip
850K) in whole blood from 26 obese (zBMI > 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal
children (zBMI < 1). 109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated between the two
groups (methylation change >10% and FDR value <0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were
located within the SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like) gene.  

Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian Randomization test, which allows
determining whether a particular CpG site is causal or consequence for the disease.
Strikingly, we found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for
multiple disorders, including not only childhood obesity, but also type 2
diabetes, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was
similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the contiguous
genes COL6A2 (Collagen Type VI Alpha 2 Chain), LSS (Lanosterol Synthase), YBEY (YbeY
Metallopeptidase) and C21orf58 were differentially expressed between the two groups.  

Together, we show that childhood obesity is associated to a small change in DNA
methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG sites appeared to play a
causative role in the development of the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites
might mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically close genes.
