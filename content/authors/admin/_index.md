I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mathematics at the University of Barcelona (UB) in June 2014. During my bachelor degree studies, I focused my interests on topics related to Statistics. I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics and Operations Research (MESIO UPC-UB), a joint programme by the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTECH (UPC), in June 2016. My master thesis was titled "Relative Efficiency between two tests" supervised by Prof. Guadalupe Gómez Melis. 

Since September 2016, I am PhD student in the Statistics and Operations Research Doctorate Programme of UPC under the supervision of Prof. Guadalupe Gómez Melis. My research is focused on clinical trials designs involving multiple outcomes.
