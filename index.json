In this article, we present methods to incorporate non-concurrent control data in treatment-control comparisons, allowing for time trends.

We examine the impact of time trends, overlap between experimental treatment arms and entry times of arms in the trial on the operating characteristics of treatment effect estimators for each method under different patterns for the time trends.

While incorporating this data can lead to increased power and lower required sample sizes, it might also introduce bias to the effect estimators if temporal drifts are present in the trial. Aiming to mitigate the potential calendar time bias, we propose various frequentist model-based approaches that leverage the non-concurrent control data, while adjusting for time trends. One of the currently available frequentist models incorporates time as a categorical fixed effect, separating the duration of the trial into periods, defined as time intervals bounded by any treatment arm entering or leaving the platform. In this work, we propose two extensions of this model. First, we consider an alternative definition of the time covariate by dividing the trial into fixed-length calendar time intervals. Second, we propose alternative methods to adjust for time trends. In particular, we investigate adjusting for autocorrelated random effects to account for dependency between closer time intervals and employing spline regression to model time with a smooth polynomial function. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches in a simulation study and illustrate their use by means of a case study.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical modeling to adjust for time trends in adaptive platform trials utilizing non-concurrent controls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lasse Fischer","Marta Bofill Roig","Werner Brannath"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract: In this paper we consider online multiple testing with familywise error rate (FWER) control, where the probability of committing at least one type I error shall remain under control while testing a possibly infinite sequence of hypotheses over time.

Now, our main contribution is a uniform improvement of the ADDIS principle and thus of all ADDIS procedures. This means, the methods we propose reject as least as much hypotheses as ADDIS procedures and in some cases even more, while maintaining FWER control. In addition, we show that our principle cannot be further uniformly improved.

Arms to test experimental interventions may enter and leave the platform over time. This implies that the number of experimental intervention arms in the trial may change over time. Determining optimal allocation rates to allocate patients to the treatment and control arms in platform trials is challenging because the change in treatment arms implies that also the optimal allocation rates will change when treatments enter or leave the platform. In addition, the optimal allocation depends on the analysis strategy used. In this paper, we derive optimal treatment allocation rates for platform trials with shared controls, assuming that a stratified estimation and testing procedure based on a regression model, is used to adjust for time trends. We consider both, analysis using concurrent controls only as well as analysis methods based on also non-concurrent controls and assume that the total sample size is fixed. The objective function to be minimized is the maximum of the variances of the effect estimators. We show that the optimal solution depends on the entry time of the arms in the trial and, in general, does not correspond to the square root of k allocation rule used in the classical multi-arm trials. We illustrate the optimal allocation and evaluate the power and type 1 error rate compared to trials using one-to-one and square root of k allocations by means of a case study.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal allocation strategies in platform trials with continuous endpoints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavla Krotka","Katharina Hees","Peter Jacko","Dominic Magirr","Martin Posch","Marta Bofill Roig"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract: Platform trials evaluate the efficacy of multiple treatments, allowing for late entry of the experimental arms and enabling efficiency gains by sharing controls.

In contemporary research, online error control is often required, where an error criterion, such as familywise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR), shall remain under control while testing an a priori unbounded sequence of hypotheses. Although the classical graphical procedure can be extended to the online setting, previous work has shown that it leads to low power, and other approaches, such as Adaptive-Discard (ADDIS) procedures, are preferred instead. In this paper, we introduce an ADDIS-Graph with FWER control and its extension for the FDR setting. These graphical ADDIS procedures combine the good interpretability of graphical procedures with the high online power of ADDIS procedures. Moreover, they can be adapted to a local dependence structure and an asynchronous testing setup, leading to power improvements over the current state-of-art methods. Consequently, the proposed methods are useful for a wide range of applications, including innovative complex trial designs, such as platform trials, and large-scale test designs, such as in the evaluation of A/B tests for marketing research.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"09aa70010d06c8827c3fe2b3cb7632b9","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/fbb_2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/fbb_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: In recent years, graphical multiple testing procedures have gained popularity due to their generality and ease of interpretation.

For a given experimental arm, non-concurrent controls refer to patients allocated to the control arm before the arm enters the trial, while concurrent controls refer to control patients that are randomised concurrently to the experimental arm. Using non-concurrent controls can result in bias in the estimate in case of time trends if the appropriate methodology is not used and the assumptions are not met. In this paper, we faced two main objectives. In the first, we aimed to identify the methods currently available for incorporating non-concurrent controls, clarify the key concepts and assumptions, and name the main characteristics of each method. For this purpose, we systematically searched research articles on methods to include non-concurrent controls. The second objective is to summarise the current regulatory view on non-concurrent controls to clarify the key concepts and current guidance. Therefore, we conducted a systematic search in regulatory guidelines regarding using non-concurrent controls and summarised the most relevant arguments and recommended methods.

Despite being commonly used, composite endpoints entail challenges in designing and interpreting results. Given that the components may be of different relevance and have different effect sizes, the choice of components must be made carefully. Especially, sample size calculations for composite binary endpoints depend not only on the anticipated effect sizes and event probabilities of the composite components, but also on the correlation between them. However, information on the correlation between endpoints is usually not reported in the literature which can be an obstacle for planning of future sound trial design. We consider two-arm randomized controlled trials with a primary composite binary endpoint and an endpoint that consists only of the clinically more important component of the composite endpoint. We propose a trial design that allows an adaptive modification of the primary endpoint based on blinded information obtained at an interim analysis. Especially, we consider a decision rule to select between a composite endpoint and its most relevant component as primary endpoint. The decision rule chooses the endpoint with the lower estimated required sample size. Additionally, the sample size is reassessed using the estimated event probabilities and correlation, and the expected effect sizes of the composite components. We investigate the statistical power and significance level under the proposed design through simulations. We show that the adaptive design is equally or more powerful than designs without adaptive modification on the primary endpoint. Besides, the targeted power is achieved even if the correlation is misspecified at the planning stage while maintaining the type 1 error.

Designing trials with time-to-event endpoints can be particularly challenging because the proportional hazard assumption usually does not hold when using a composite endpoint, even when the premise remains true for their components.

We present the R package CompAREdesign by means of which the key elements of trial designs, such as the sample size and effect sizes, can be computed based on the information on the composite endpoint components. CompAREdesign provides the functions to assess the sensitivity and robustness of design calculations to variations in initial values and assumptions. Furthermore, we describe other features of the package, such as functions for the design of trials with binary composite endpoints, and functions to simulate trials with composite endpoints under a wide range of scenarios.\n","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"763cc1396f5fd0de5eae487b2c1aaa67","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/cbg_2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/cbg_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Composite endpoints are widely used as primary endpoints in clinical trials.

The number of treatments is not fixed, as arms may be added or removed as the trial progresses. Platform trials are more efficient than independent parallel-group trials because of using shared control groups. For arms entering the trial later, not all patients in the control group are randomised concurrently. The control group is then divided into concurrent and non-concurrent controls. Using non-concurrent controls (NCC) can improve the trial\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, but can introduce bias due to time trends. We focus on a platform trial with two treatment arms and a common control arm. Assuming that the second treatment arm is added later, we assess the robustness of model-based approaches to adjust for time trends when using NCC. We consider approaches where time trends are modeled as linear or as a step function, with steps at times where arms enter or leave the trial. For trials with continuous or binary outcomes, we investigate the type 1 error (t1e) rate and power of testing the efficacy of the newly added arm under a range of scenarios. In addition to scenarios where time trends are equal across arms, we investigate settings with trends that are different or not additive in the model scale. A step function model fitted on data from all arms gives increased power while controlling the t1e, as long as the time trends are equal for the different arms and additive on the model scale. This holds even if the trend\u0026rsquo;s shape deviates from a step function if block randomisation is used. But if trends differ between arms or are not additive on the model scale, t1e control may be lost. The efficiency gained by using step function models to incorporate NCC can outweigh potential biases. However, the specifics of the trial, plausibility of different time trends, and robustness of results should be considered.\n","date":1659571200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659571200,"objectID":"a8d335eded258e7456d0caa28d46db85","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/bp_2021/","publishdate":"2022-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/bp_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: Platform trials can evaluate the efficacy of several treatments compared to a control.

If granted, a two-arm confirmatory trial is often required to demonstrate the efficacy with a time-to-event outcome such as overall survival. However, the design of a subsequent phase III trial based on prior information on the pCR effect is not straightforward. Aiming at designing such phase III trials with overall survival as primary endpoint using pCR information from previous trials, we consider a mixture model that incorporates both the survival and the binary endpoints. We propose to base the comparison between arms on the difference of the restricted mean survival times, and show how the effect size and sample size for overall survival rely on the probability of the binary response and the survival distribution by response status, both for each treatment arm. Moreover, we provide the sample size calculation under different scenarios and accompany them with an R package where all the computations have been implemented.

When designing a trial, it is crucial to determine the appropriate sample size for testing the statistical differences between treatment groups for the primary endpoint. As shown in this work, when using a composite binary endpoint to size a trial, one needs to specify the event rates and the effect sizes of the composite components as well as the correlation between them. In practice, the marginal parameters of the components can be obtained from previous studies or pilot trials, however, the correlation is often not previously reported and thus usually unknown. We first show that the sample size for composite binary endpoints is strongly dependent on the correlation and, second, that slight deviations in the prior information on the marginal parameters may result in underpowered trials for achieving the study objectives at a pre-specified significance level. We propose a general strategy for calculating the required sample size when the correlation is not specified, and accounting for uncertainty in the marginal parameter values. We present the web platform CompARE to characterize composite endpoints and to calculate the sample size just as we propose in this paper. We evaluate the performance of the proposal with a simulation study, and illustrate it by means of a real case study using CompARE.\n","date":1530576000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530576000,"objectID":"f896575860c7f5c3f53051248b64104f","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/bg_2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/bg_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: Composite binary endpoints are increasingly used as primary endpoints in clinical trials.

It is common to use composite endpoints as a primary endpoint because it increases the number of observed events, captures more information and is expected to increase the power. However, combining events that have no similar clinical importance and have different treatment effects makes the interpretation of the results cumbersome and might reduce the power of the corresponding tests. Gómez and Lagakos proposed the ARE (asymptotic relative efficiency) method to choose between a composite or one of its components as primary endpoint comparing the efficacy of a treatment based on the times to each of these endpoints. The aim of this paper is to expand the ARE method to binary endpoints. We show that the ARE method depends on six parameters including the degree of association between components, event proportion, and effect of therapy given by the corresponding odds ratio of the single endpoints. A case study is presented to illustrate the methodology. We conclude with efficient guidelines for discerning which could be the best suited primary endpoint given anticipated parameters.\n","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507766400,"objectID":"b3c0968788449f55c1d0e58da8245fc6","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/bg_2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/bg_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract: The choice of a primary endpoint is an important issue when designing a clinical trial.
