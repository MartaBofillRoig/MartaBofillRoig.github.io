      <description>Summary points: - This article considers the combination of two binary or two time-to-event endpoints to form the primary composite endpoint for leading a trial. - It discusses the relative efficiency of choosing a composite endpoint over one of its components in terms of: the frequencies of observing each component; the relative treatment effect of the tested therapy; and the association between both components. - We highlight the very important role of the association between components in choosing the most efficient endpoint to use as primary.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Composite binary endpoints are increasingly used as primary endpoints in clinical trials. When designing a trial, it is crucial to determine the appropriate sample size for testing the statistical differences between treatment groups for the primary endpoint. As shown in this work, when using a composite binary endpoint to size a trial, one needs to specify the event rates and the effect sizes of the composite components as well as the correlation between them.</description>

      <title>Selection of composite binary endpoints in clinical trials</title>

      <description>Abstract: The choice of a primary endpoint is an important issue when designing a clinical trial. It is common to use composite endpoints as a primary endpoint because it increases the number of observed events, captures more information and is expected to increase the power. However, combining events that have no similar clinical importance and have different treatment effects makes the interpretation of the results cumbersome and might reduce the power of the corresponding tests.</description>
