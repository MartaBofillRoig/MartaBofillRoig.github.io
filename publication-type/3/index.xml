      <title>Design of Trials with Composite Endpoints with the R Package CompAREdesign</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; 
Composite endpoints are widely used as primary endpoints in clinical trials. Designing trials with time-to-event endpoints can be particularly challenging because the proportional hazard assumption usually does not hold when using a composite endpoint, even when the premise remains true for their components. Consequently, the conventional formulae for sample size calculation do not longer apply. We present the R package CompAREdesign by means of which the key elements of trial designs, such as the sample size and effect sizes, can be computed based on the information on the composite endpoint components. CompAREdesign provides the functions to 
assess the sensitivity and robustness of design calculations to variations in initial values and assumptions. Furthermore, we describe other features of the package, such as functions for the design of trials with binary composite endpoints, and functions to simulate trials with composite endpoints under a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article considers the combination of two binary or two time-to-event endpoints to form the primary composite endpoint for leading a trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It discusses the relative efficiency of choosing a composite endpoint over one of its components in terms of: the frequencies of observing each component; the relative treatment effect of the tested therapy; and the association between both components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We highlight the very important role of the association between components in choosing the most efficient endpoint to use as primary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For better grounded future trials, we recommend trialists to always reporting the association between components of the composite endpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common fallacies to note when using composite endpoints: i) composite endpoints always imply higher power; ii) treatment effect on the composite endpoint is similar to the average effects of its components; and iii) the probability of observing the primary endpoint increases significantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
